This simple mod adds Jaffa Cakes (brownies, cream rolls, ice creams and more) into the game. I tried to make a not so easy craft chain - this mod has been mainly created to add extra content which could be used in factory designing and building.

GUI of a fridge. This machine is used to freeze ice-creams, sometimes generates ice and snowballs. Fridge needs fuel to operate (1 coal should burn for half hour). The inner temperature has to be below -5°C for the ice to be generated and food to be frozen (frozen food is marked by a snowflake in the top right corner).[/spoiler]

[size=6]Notes[/size]
[spoiler]I recommend using some recipe mod - like [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-125132-smp-chickenbones-mods/"]Not Enough Items (NEI)[/url] or [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/731133-132-craftguide-v152/"]CraftGuide[/url]. Jaffas mod is good for automatization because of large crafting chains. If you're planning to build your own factory remember to use [b]Automatic Crafting Table MkII[/b] from Immibiss's [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1001131-125132-immibiss-mods-smp-tubestuff-5001-core-5003-da-5001/"]TubeStuff[/url] for recipes that doesn't consume items (auto crafting table from BuildCraft3 destroys returned items!).

[size=6]About[/size]
[spoiler]Hello, this is my first mod (and first thing in java), so the code is a bit messy. Yet, it's tested and functional in SSP and SMP (not sure about LAN). Author of images is Tiartyos.

Item IDs can be changed in config file. Default item IDs are [b]4009-4053[/b] (with ID shift, in config items are without shift). 

Plans/TODO list
[spoiler][list]
[*]add more config options - heal amount, disable recipes, ...
[*][s](code) fix names, remove unused clasess[/s] done
[/list]
thoughts[list]
[*][s]? tools lasting longer (dmg counter) - would have to solve automation problems[/s] done
[*]? recipes for IC2 machines, e.g. macerator - cocoa beans -> powder
[*]? fruit trees or some plants?
[/list]
